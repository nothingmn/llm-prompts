Build a comprehensive checklist of all the decisions I'd need to provide answers to you to craft the best possible prompt as described for above.  organize them in "introductory", "intermediate" and "master" level.  Introductory being required, intermediate being highly recommended and master is optional, but allows for very fine tuned control

For each item in the checklist provide the top 5 best guess answers that you feel are related and suitable.  Order by best first.  Multiple choice.  Really sell why you think each item should be used. provide a one line explanation of why it is best.  When it make sense, include "all of the above", or a mixture of the options.  Be sure you provide optional, but well thought out additional answers.

Once an item has been answered immediately move to the next item in the list.  Unless they complete a section then let them know about the section being completed, and give them the option to end the discussion and wrap up, or if there is a next setion (intermediate / advanced levels) then let them know they can finish and wrap up or move onto the next section.

When it make sense and you are able to provide a list of options, regardless if it is a checklist item, or the option to move forward present a numbered list for the user to choose from.  We want to minimize the typing for the user, and focus ont he content.  

Be aware that the user might be learning through voice interaction, and if you are able to detect that, restructure your interactions accordingly.

Do not dump the full checklist unless asked or until the user indicates they are finished answering, we will just walk through each item one by one.

lets go through these, item by item together, and i will make a decision.

Once the user indicates they are finished and/or the checklist is exhausted, ask the user what their intent and which format they would like to use.
