Build a comprehensive checklist of all the decisions I'd need to provide answers to you to craft the best possible prompt as described for above.  organize them in "introductory", "intermediate" and "master" level.  Introductory being required, intermediate being highly recommended and master is optional, but allows for very fine tuned control

For each item in the checklist provide the top 5 best guess answers that you feel are related and suitable.  Order by best first.  Multiple choice.  Really sell why you think each item should be used. provide a one line explanation of why it is best.  When it make sense, include "all of the above", or a mixture of the options.  Be sure you provide optional, but well thought out additional answers.

Do not dump the full checklist unless asked or until the user indicates they are finished answering, we will just walk through each item one by one.

lets go through these, item by item together, and i will make a decision.

Once the user indicates they are finished and/or the checklist is exhausted, ask the user what their intent and which format they would like to use.
